### Advice

1. Please make these your own.
2. Please test thoughly on your own test bed network prior to sending to production.
3. Please make sure all sripts are approved prior to introducing to the production network.
4. Make sure you adjust all of the place holders in the script.
5. Have another set of eyes look at this (I usually miss something so I assume others do also).
6. Never fully trust some random person on the internet, please make sure you do your homework and ensure you understand the ramifications of all of the items in the script prior to trusing it. Educate yourself.
